            <h3>Status Quo</h3>

            <p>This project emerged from 2014's ODHK hackathon, let by Han Xu. The initial team members include Han Xu, Pili Hu, Vincent Lau, Toby Lam, to name a few. The frontend was freely hosted on GitHub for years. The backend was first hosted by Pili
                Hu in CUHK and then by CODE4HK for another year. Known hosting services distincted as of 2016. The current version you are reading is rebooted by <a href="hupili.net">Pili Hu</a> on Oct 22, 2017. There is no clear plan of how long this
                service will sustain. There is an all-in-one box docker image available released under MIT. Feel free to host elsewhere. Emails are welcome if you need assistance. </p>

            <h3>What is a "gazetteer"?</h3>
            <p>
                Most people may think of "gazette," as in a newspaper, but a gazetteer is actually completely different. As early as Ancient Greece, gazetteers were publications that contained geographic and demographic information about a location, essentially a geographic
                dictionary or almanac.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gazetteer HK is a modern day version of this concept. We collect a variety of data sources into a single unified and standardized database, available for anyone to use for whatever the use case.
            </p>
            <p>
                See the Wikipedia entry in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer">English</a> and
                <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9C%B0%E6%96%B9%E5%BF%97">Chinese</a> for more history about gazetteers.

            <h3>How do I use this?</h3>
            <p>
                If you're interested in seeing visualizations of the data, check out some of our pre-made apps, such as the <a href="#/profiles">Neighborhood Profiles</a>, or the <a href="#/choropleth">Data Mapper</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're interested in using the API, check out the <a href="#/browser">Data Browser</a> for documentation, and visit our <a href="https://github.com/gazetteerhk/census_explorer">GitHub page</a> for the source code.
            </p>

            <h3>What kind of use cases are there for Gazetter HK?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're a journalist, Gazetteer's Census data makes it easy for you to look up background information about a district or neighborhood that you're writing a story on.</li>
                <li>If you're a researcher, you can download our full dataset and join it to your own data for your analysis</li>
                <li>If you're in marketing, you can use our our neighborhood profiles to find out which areas to target</li>
                <li>If you're building an app that requires showing Hong Kong's districts or areas, you can use our GeoJSON files to draw the map</li>
                <li>Or maybe you just like open data and cool visualizations (who doesn't?)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We'd love to hear from your about your use case. Get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:contact@gazetteer.hk">contact@gazetteer.hk.</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Where did you get your data?</h3>
            <p>
                The Hong Kong Government has made publicly available a number of official data sets through the <a href="http://data.one.gov.hk">Data.One project</a>. The <a href="http://www.gov.hk/en/theme/psi/datasets/2011cdistrictprofiles.htm">2011 Census dataset</a>                makes up the bulk of our data.
            </p>

            <h3>How much does it cost to use the API?</h3>
            <p>
                Nothing! At the moment, we don't have plans to charge for API usage. Our project is also fully open source, and contains the scripts necessary to generate our full dataset from scratch.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I contribute?</h3>
            <p>
                Absolutely. Check out some of the issues on our issue tracker, fork the code on Github and send a pull request. If you can't contribute code but have ideas or questions, get in touch with us at
                <a href="mailto:contact@gazetter.hk">contact@gazetteer.hk</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>What's your relationship with <a href="http://opendatahk.com" target="_blank">Open Data Hong Kong?</a></h3>
            <p>
                We formed our team and started this project at ODHK's <a href="http://opendatahk.com/articles/make-02/" target="_blank">Make.02</a> hackathon. While our main contributors are not staff members of ODHK, this project would not have been
                possible without ODHK's support.
            </p>

            <h3>What's your stack?</h3>
            <p>
                Our backend API was built with Python using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" target="_blank">Flask</a>. Flask interacts directly with a <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org" target="_blank">pandas</a> DataFrame to query the data, so there
                is no database involved.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our frontend is built primarily using <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
                <a href="http://leafletjs.org" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>, and <a href="http://dimplejs.org" target="_blank">
        dimple</a>, which builds on top of the <a href="http://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3js</a> framework. For translations, we use <a href="http://i18next.com" target="_blank">i18next</a>. There are also a handful of other plugins and utilities that
                we use. Check out our
                <a href="https://github.com/gazetteerhk/census_explorer/blob/master/frontend/bower.json">bower file</a> for full details.
