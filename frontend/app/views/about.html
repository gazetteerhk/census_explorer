<h1>General questions: </h1>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>

<p>
  We are a collection of open data advocates from Hong Kong. We believe that open,
  accessible data is vital to improving the overall health and well-being of Hong Kong.
  In that spirit, we built Hong Kong Census Explorer to provide a platform for easily creating,
  sharing, and exploring the Hong Kong government.
</p>

<h3>Why did you build this?</h3>

<p>
  With this open-source project, we hope to make a previously cumbersome task --
  exploring the data generated by the Hong Kong government’s census -- easily accessible by journalists,
  advocates, developers, and interested citizens.
</p>

<p>
  By providing a JSON-based API to the data, we hope to encourage active development,
  exploration and investigation. Our open-source platform allows anyone to develop mashups and
  visualizations and contribute them back to our community.
</p>

<h3>How do I use this?</h3>

<p>
  There are two ways to interact with this data.
</p>

<p>
  As an end-user, you can browse the data and view the various mashups and visualizations built with the data here.
</p>

<p>
  As a developer, you can build and contribute your own visualizations. When complete,
  you can email us details or simply submit them as a pull-request on Github.
  More details about this are below. You can also help us improve our core code as well. There’s always something that needs work.
</p>

<h3>Can I help contribute?</h3>

<p>
  Absolutely. Fork the code on Github and send a pull request.
  Or build your own visualization and tell us about it. Or just email us to see how you can help!
</p>

<h1>Technical questions</h1>

<h3>
  What’s powering Hong Kong Census Explorer?
</h3>

<p>
  Our backend API was built with Python/Flask, and is running on Google App Engine.
  The data from the Hong Kong Government was retrieved and normalized using a myriad of Python scripts.
</p>

<p>
  Our frontend is built using AngularJS. Visualizations are largely built using the d3.js javascript framework
  (or any other appropriate Javascript framework -- refer to the source for each visualization for more details.)
